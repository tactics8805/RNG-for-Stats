# RNG-for-Stats
The program is a Random Number Generator intended for use in statitics or statistical fields.

I originally made the code for this program on KhanAcademy since I was in AP Stats and needed a way to generate random numbers quickly. We use a website called Stapplet but I don't think that I will be constantly using that application 24/7 and it's much more convenient to have your own downloadable version. Also, I was really just bored. Anyways here is the link to the original version of the project I made on KhanAcademy: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/random-number-generator-for-stats/5809370954645504 

This version on Github I had to change because KhanAcademy processing js applications are very outdated and I needed this to work on an html file otherwise it would defeat the whole purpose of personal and convinient. Anways, enjoy this creation!
